# Backend Service with OpenAPI Specification

This repository contains the implementation of a backend service along with its API documentation using OpenAPI. The project is divided into two main components:

- **Backend Service Repository**: Contains the core logic and implementation of the backend services.
- **OpenAPI Specification**: Defines the API endpoints, requests, and responses for the service.

---

## Repository Structure

### 1. **Backend Service**
This folder contains the backend service implementation, including:
- Service logic
- Controller implementation
- Request/Response handling

### 2. **OpenAPI Specification**
The OpenAPI documentation is provided in YAML and XML formats and is divided into two files for modularity:

#### **a. Specific Controller YAML**
- Defines endpoints for a specific controller.
- Includes:
  - Request structure
  - Response structure
  - Endpoint details

#### **b. Common YAML**
- Documents common endpoints shared across multiple controllers/services.
- Useful for reusability and reducing redundancy.
